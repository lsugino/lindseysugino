	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Lindsey Sugino and I am a web developer living in San Francisco.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am a recent graduate from Dev BootCamp, an intensive 9-week web development program that emphasizes agile development. At DBC, I spent over 900 hours writing code, learning about best practices, and working in pairs or groups to watch our code break and figure out a solution together.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before DBC, I was in online marketing for two years with an emphasis on display advertising, e-mail marketing, social media, and market user interface design. Spending 2 years A/B testing and optimizing ads, layouts, copy and colors made me interested in learning how to build the pages that I had spent so much time testing.
